# Introduction

Before we dive into the specifics of embedded systems and robotics, let's first discuss what exactly we mean by these terms. 

> An embedded system is a computer system designed to perform specific functions, often with real-time computing constraints. 

> The Arduino and Raspberry Pi are two popular platforms for building embedded systems. Robotics, on the other hand, is the field of engineering and science that deals with the design, construction, and operation of robots. Robots can be used for a variety of purposes, such as manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and entertainment. 

> By combining embedded systems with robotics, we can build intelligent machines that can sense their environment, make decisions based on that information, and act accordingly.

## Getting Started

To get started with robotics using embedded systems, you will need a few basic components:

- An Arduino or Raspberry Pi board
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Sensors (e.g. ultrasonic sensor, temperature sensor, light sensor)
- Actuators (e.g. servo motor, DC motor, LED)
- Power source (e.g. battery pack, USB cable)

Once you have these components, you can start building basic circuits and programming them using the appropriate software tools.

## Arduino Basics

The Arduino is a popular microcontroller platform that is easy to use and affordable. It is based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller and comes with its own integrated development environment (IDE) that allows you to write, compile, and upload code to the board.

To get started with Arduino, you should first learn the basics of C/C++ programming language. Then, you can start building simple circuits and programming them using the Arduino IDE. Some important concepts to understand include:

- Digital input/output
- Analog input/output
- PWM (pulse width modulation)
- Serial communication

> Another important concept to understand when working with Arduino is the concept of a "sketch". A sketch in Arduino refers to the code that you write and upload to the board. The sketch consists of two main functions: the setup function and the loop function.

> The setup function is called once when the board starts up, and it is where you can initialize any pins or variables that your program will use. The loop function is called repeatedly while the board is running, and it is where you write the main logic of your program.

> Arduino also supports a vast number of libraries that can make programming tasks easier. These libraries provide pre-written code for common tasks like controlling motors, reading sensor data, and communicating with other devices.

> When working with Arduino, it is important to keep safety in mind. Always double-check your circuit connections before powering up the board, and avoid touching any exposed wires or components while the board is powered on.That's why you should always use an online simulation platform such as TinkerCard.

## Raspberry Pi Basics
The Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer that can be used as a standalone device or as part of a larger system. It is based on the ARM processor and runs a version of the Linux operating system. The Raspberry Pi has many built-in features, including USB ports, Ethernet, HDMI, and GPIO (general-purpose input/output) pins.

To get started with Raspberry Pi, you should first become familiar with the Linux operating system and the Python programming language. Then, you can start building projects that take advantage of the Raspberry Pi's features, such as:

- Web servers
 - Media centers
 - Home automation systems
 - Robotics projects

> In addition to the built-in features, the Raspberry Pi can be expanded and customized with various add-ons and accessories. These include camera modules, touchscreens, and various types of sensors such as temperature, humidity, and motion sensors.

> One of the great things about the Raspberry Pi is its versatility and affordability, making it accessible to students, hobbyists, and professionals alike. Its low cost makes it an excellent platform for experimentation and prototyping of various projects.

> The Raspberry Pi community is also very active and supportive, with many forums, blogs, and online communities dedicated to sharing knowledge and helping each other with projects. This makes it a great place to learn and collaborate with others who share your interests and passion for technology.


## Sensors and Actuators

Sensors and actuators are essential components of any robotic system. Sensors allow a robot to sense its environment and detect changes, while actuators allow the robot to interact with the world around it.

Some common sensors used in robotics include:

- Ultrasonic sensor
- Infrared sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Light sensor
- Accelerometer

Some common actuators used in robotics include:

- Servo motor
- DC motor
- Stepper motor
- LED
- Buzzer

There are many different types of sensors and actuators available, each with their own specifications and capabilities. You should choose the ones that best suit your project's needs.


## Communication Protocols

Communication protocols are essential for connecting different components of a robotic system together. Some common communication protocols used in robotics include:

- Serial communication (e.g. UART)
- I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
- SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi

Understanding how these protocols work and how to use them is essential for building complex robotic systems.

## Advanced Topics

Once you have mastered the basics of embedded systems and robotics, you can start exploring more advanced topics such as:

- Machine learning
- Computer vision
- Control systems
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- Robotics frameworks (e.g. ROS)

These topics require a deeper understanding of computer science and engineering, but they can open up new possibilities for building intelligent and complex robotic systems.
